Project README
==============

Overview
--------

This project is a Flutter application that manages workouts using a clean architecture approach. The architecture includes the use of repositories and providers to manage state and data flow efficiently.

Architecture
------------

The project follows the repository and provider pattern for managing data and state:

*   **Repositories:** Responsible for data access and manipulation. They act as an abstraction layer between the data sources (like databases or APIs) and the rest of the application. This project uses Hive as the local database solution, managed through repository classes.
*   **Providers:** Used to manage the state of the application. Providers interact with repositories to fetch and update data. They notify the UI of changes, ensuring that the application reflects the current state.

Why Hive?
---------

Hive is chosen as the local database for this project due to its lightweight nature and ease of use. It provides a simple key-value store, which is efficient for storing small to medium amounts of data. Hive is also fast and supports Flutter well, making it a good fit for this application.

Setup Instructions
------------------

1.  **Install Dependencies**

    Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies by running:

        flutter pub get

2.  **Generate Hive Adapters**

    Hive uses adapters to convert data to and from its storage format. To generate these adapters, run:

        flutter packages pub run build_runner build

3.  **Initialize Hive**

    Initialize Hive in your application before accessing any data. This is typically done in the `main()` function of your Flutter app:


        void main() async {
            WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
            await Hive.initFlutter();
            runApp(MyApp());
        }


4.  **Run the App**

    Start the application using:

        flutter run

5.  **Run Tests**

    To ensure everything is working correctly, run the tests:

        flutter test
